				<h1>🧙🏽‍♀️ Witches of the World</h1>
				<p class="lead">
					A modern blog exploring witchcraft, folk magic, and
					spiritual practices as they exist across cultures,
					histories, and living communities.
				</p>

			<section>
				<h2>What This Space Is</h2>
				<p>
					Witchcraft is not a single tradition—it is many. From
					European folk magic and African diasporic practices, to
					Indigenous spiritual systems, Asian shamanic lineages, and
					contemporary global witchcraft, this blog approaches magic
					as something grounded in place, culture, and lived
					experience.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here, witches are not stereotypes or aesthetics. They are
					healers, rebels, ritualists, scholars, ancestors, and
					neighbors. Magic is examined with curiosity, respect, and
					historical context.
				</p>
